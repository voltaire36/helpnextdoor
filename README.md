# HelpNextDoor

**A full-stack, community-driven web platform** designed to connect neighbors who need help with those willing to provide it. Built using a modern microservices and microfrontend architecture, it supports user-driven posts, AI-assisted recommendations, and secure role-based access.

## What It Is

HelpNextDoor is a modular web application that enables local residents, business owners, and community organizers to:

- Post and respond to help requests  
- Join public discussions  
- Share community news  
- Interact with an integrated AI assistant  

The system consists of three major components:

| Service                 | Purpose                                        |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `helpnextdoor-frontend` | Microfrontend SPA using React + Bootstrap      |
| `auth-service`          | Handles user authentication & role management |
| `community-service`     | Manages posts, help requests, comments & AI    |
